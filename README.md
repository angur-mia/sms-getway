<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshot.png" width="360"></p>


Android SMS Gateway is a lightweight application that allows you to use your Android smartphone as an SMS gateway. With this app, you can send SMS messages programmatically via API, making it ideal for integrating SMS functionality into your own applications or services. The application supports Android 5.0 and above, and offers features such as message status tracking, starting at boot, and protection from going to sleep. Whether you need to send notifications, alerts, or two-factor authentication codes, Android SMS Gateway provides a convenient and reliable solution.

The project is in the MVP stage.

2. Download the latest APK file from the list of available releases.
3. Transfer the APK file to your Android device.
4. On your Android device, go to **Settings** > **Security** (or **Privacy** on some devices).
5. Enable the **Unknown sources** option to allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store.
6. Use a file manager app to navigate to the location of the downloaded APK file.
7. Tap on the APK file to start the installation process.
8. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The Android SMS Gateway can work in two modes: with a local server started on the device or with a remote server at [sms.capcom.me](https://sms.capcom.me). The basic API is the same for both modes and is documented on the [Android SMS Gateway API Documentation](https://capcom6.github.io/android-sms-gateway/).


### Send SMS with local server

Application can start web-server on the device, so it can be used without any external services. This mode is recommended for sending messages from local network.

1. Start the app on the device.
2. Activate the `Local server` switch.
3. Tap the `Offline` button at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the `Local server` section, the local and public addresses of the device, along with the credentials for basic authentication, will be displayed. Please note that the public address is only usable if you have a "white" IP address and have correctly configured your firewall.
5. Make a `curl` call from the local network using a command like the following, replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<device_local_ip>` with the values obtained in step 4: 
   
   ```
   curl -X POST -u <username>:<password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "message": "Hello, world!", "phoneNumbers": ["79990001234", "79995556677"] }' http://<device_local_ip>:8080/message
   ```

### Send SMS with sms.capcom.me

If you need to send messages with dynamic or shared device IP you can use the remote server.

1. Start the app on the device.
2. Activate the `Remote server` switch.
3. Tap the `Offline` button at the bottom of the screen.
4. In the `Remote server` section, the credentials for basic authentication will be displayed.
5. Make a curl call using a command like the following, replacing `<username>` and `<password>` with the values obtained in step 4:
   
    ```
    curl -X POST -u <username>:<password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "message": "Hello, world!", "phoneNumbers": ["79990001234", "79995556677"] }' https://sms.capcom.me/api/3rdparty/v1/message
    ```
